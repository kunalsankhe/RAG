# RAG
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline with LangChain, ChromaDB, and Groq LLM


This repository demonstrates a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow in Python. It covers document ingestion, chunking, embedding generation with SentenceTransformer, vector storage using ChromaDB, retrieval, and answer generation using Groq-hosted LLMs via LangChain. The included notebook provides step-by-step explanations, code, and sample data for building and understanding RAG systems.
